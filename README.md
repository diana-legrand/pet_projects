# Pet Projects in Data Analytics & Data Science

This repository showcases a collection of my personal projects focused on data analytics and data science. Each project is designed to explore real-world data, apply statistical or machine learning techniques, and build clear, insightful visualizations.
| Project Title | Description | Libraries Used |  
| :---------------------- | :---------------------- | :---------------------- |
| [Hockey Network Analysis](hockey_project) | Developed a graph-based model to analyze player connections within the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). Introduced the concept of the Lemtyugov Number â€” a measure of proximity between players based on shared team history with Nikolai Lemtyugov. Built network visualizations and tested hypotheses about team structure and player dynamics.| *Pandas*, *Networkx*, *SciPy*, *Pingouin*, *Matplotlib*, *Seaborn*|
| [Structural Equation Modeling Approach to Organizational Culture and Employee Behavior](sem_project) | Conducted behavioral research on the relationship between organizational culture types and employee engagement. Applied Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) in Python (semopy), performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and analyzed the mediation effects of latent variables..| *Pandas*, *Networkx*, *SciPy*, *Pingouin*, *Matplotlib*, *Seaborn*|
| [Impact of Coping Strategy on Employee Performance](coping_project) | Investigated how different coping strategies (problem-focused, emotion-ocused, avoidance) influence employee performance levels. Conducted hypothesis testing (t-tests, ANOVA) to detect differences between coping strategy groups. Built regression models (linear/multiple regression) to predict performance based on coping mechanisms.| *Pandas*, *Networkx*, *SciPy*, *Pingouin*, *Matplotlib*, *Seaborn*|
