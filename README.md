# Pet Projects in Data Analytics & Data Science

This repository showcases a collection of my personal projects focused on data analytics and data science. Each project is designed to explore real-world data, apply statistical or machine learning techniques, and build clear, insightful visualizations.
| Project Title | Description | Libraries Used |  
| :---------------------- | :---------------------- | :---------------------- |
| [Hockey Network Analysis](hockey_project) | Developed a graph-based model to analyze player connections within the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). Introduced the concept of the Lemtyugov Number â€” a measure of proximity between players based on shared team history with Nikolai Lemtyugov. Built network visualizations and tested hypotheses about team structure and player dynamics.| *Pandas*, *Networkx*, *SciPy*, *Pingouin*, *Matplotlib*, *Seaborn*|
| [Structural Equation Modeling Approach](sem_project) | Conducted a behavioral research on the relationship between organizational culture types and employee engagement. Applied Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) using Python (semopy), performed Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), and analyzed mediation effects.| *Pandas*, *Networkx*, *SciPy*, *Pingouin*, *Matplotlib*, *Seaborn*|
| [Impact of Coping Strategy on Employee Performance](coping_project) | Investigated how different coping strategies (problem-focused, emotion-ocused, avoidance) influence employee performance levels. Conducted hypothesis testing (t-tests, ANOVA) to detect differences between coping strategy groups. Built regression models (linear/multiple regression) to predict performance based on coping mechanisms.| *Pandas*, *Networkx*, *SciPy*, *Pingouin*, *Matplotlib*, *Seaborn*|
