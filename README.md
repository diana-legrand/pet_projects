# Pet Projects in Data Analytics & Data Science

This repository showcases a collection of my personal projects focused on data analytics and data science. Each project is designed to explore real-world data, apply statistical or machine learning techniques, and build clear, insightful visualizations.
| Project Title | Description | Libraries Used |  
| :---------------------- | :---------------------- | :---------------------- |
| [Hockey Network Analysis](hockey_project) | Built a network graph model to analyze player relationships in the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). Developed a proximity metric based on shared team history to quantify player connections. Created interactive network visualizations and tested hypotheses related to team structure and player dynamics.| *Pandas*, *Networkx*, *SciPy*, *Pingouin*, *Matplotlib*, *Seaborn*|
| [Structural Equation Modeling Approach to Organizational Culture and Employee Behavior](sem_project) | Conducted behavioral research on the relationship between organizational culture types and employee engagement. Applied Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) in Python (semopy), performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and analyzed mediation effects of latent variables related to employee behavioral characteristics.| *Pandas*, *Networkx*, *SciPy*, *Pingouin*, *Matplotlib*, *Seaborn*|
| [Impact of Coping Strategy on Employee Performance](coping_project) | Investigated how different coping strategies (problem-focused, emotion-ocused, avoidance) influence employee performance levels. Conducted hypothesis testing (t-tests, ANOVA) to detect differences between coping strategy groups. Built regression models (linear/multiple regression) to predict performance based on coping mechanisms.| *Pandas*, *Networkx*, *SciPy*, *Pingouin*, *Matplotlib*, *Seaborn*|
